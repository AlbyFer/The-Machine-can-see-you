Objective of the program: bulding a classifier to categorize plankton images of 120 different species.
How: Various methods of image processing and feature extraction. As classifier, a feed-forward and a 
    convolutional neural networks have been build
    
Documents contained: 
 - Feed-forward: the .py file for feature extraction and the feed-forward NN
 - Convolutional: the .py file for feature extraction and the convolutional NN
 - Machine Vision: the whole document describing theory and the programs.
